My first GitHub Repository and the beginning of my programming progress

Well, lets talk about myself a bit (something I really love...)
I started programming at university and I think is one of the best things I have learned in my life. 
I see it as a form of art itself with thousand of useful possibilities. Programming is elegant and a 
path towards a succesful future. By the way, my name is Rocio <3
